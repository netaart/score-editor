# View parts

Use view parts when the host wants its own layout: a toolbar at the top, one track beside the score, a ruler in a
sticky header, or only the tracks and none of the controls. A part mounts on an element the host placed, binds to one
editing session, draws from what the session holds, and redraws from its notifications. It never reads another part
and never reaches into the default editor.

Every part returns a `ViewPart`: `{ destroy() }`. `destroy` removes every node, listener and style sheet the part
added; calling it twice is harmless.

## The parts

| Function | Draws | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mountZoomControl(el, session)` | The zoom-out, readout/menu and zoom-in buttons. Hidden while the session has no readable score. | — |
| `mountCutNotice(el, session)` | The one sentence saying the score text stops before the song does, or nothing. | — |
| `mountProblemView(el, session)` | Why there is no score to show: the dialect's diagnostics, or the model with no dialect. | — |
| `mountTimeRuler(el, session, options?)` | Bar numbers, section bands, and key/meter/cut marks. | `AxisPartOptions` |
| `mountChordTrack(el, session, options?)` | Each chord at the position the score gives it, or one "no chords" line. | `AxisPartOptions` |
| `mountVoiceTrack(el, session, options)` | One voice's piano roll: head, pitch column, grids and notes. | `VoiceTrackOptions` |

`AxisPartOptions` is `{ scroller?: HTMLElement }`. `VoiceTrackOptions` extends it with `voice: string`, the voice name
the dialect declares (for `song2`, `"Vocal"` or `"Ins"`).

## How the parts share the time axis

The ruler, the chord track and each voice track draw on the session's zoom and horizontal scroll. Without `scroller`
each axis part is its own scroll surface, as wide as the host's element, and a scroll or a zoom gesture on it moves
the session, so the other parts follow. Pass the same `scroller` to several parts to make them share one scroll
surface of the host's, as the default editor does.

A part mounted after the user already zoomed or scrolled starts at the session's current zoom and scroll. A part
whose score does not have its voice draws nothing; a voice with only rests still draws its empty track. A model with no
dialect leaves the axis parts empty while the problem view explains it.

## Usage

```ts
import {
  createDialectRegistry,
  createEditingSession,
  mountChordTrack,
  mountCutNotice,
  mountProblemView,
  mountTimeRuler,
  mountVoiceTrack,
  mountZoomControl,
} from "@neta-art/score-editor";
import { song2Dialect } from "@neta-art/score-dialect-song2";

const session = createEditingSession({
  project,
  dialects: createDialectRegistry([song2Dialect]),
  language: "en",
});

// The host's own markup: <div class="toolbar"></div>, <div class="roll"></div>, and so on.
const scroller = document.querySelector<HTMLElement>(".roll")!;
const parts = [
  mountZoomControl(document.querySelector(".toolbar")!, session),
  mountCutNotice(document.querySelector(".notices")!, session),
  mountTimeRuler(document.querySelector(".ruler")!, session, { scroller }),
  mountChordTrack(document.querySelector(".chords")!, session, { scroller }),
  mountVoiceTrack(document.querySelector(".vocal")!, session, { voice: "Vocal", scroller }),
  mountVoiceTrack(document.querySelector(".ins")!, session, { voice: "Ins", scroller }),
  mountProblemView(document.querySelector(".problems")!, session),
];

// Later, when the host tears the layout down:
for (const part of parts) part.destroy();
```

Each part keeps the isolation `mount` gives: its root is `div.sce-root.sce-part`, it carries the host's theme context
and reset, and it is a stacking context of its own. The package's style sheet is added once per document (or shadow
root) and removed when the last part that needs it is destroyed. Host CSS does not reach in through plain element
rules; see [theme.md](theme.md).

## Writing a view of your own

A custom view needs no special base class. Read `session.project`, `session.reading`, `session.selection`,
`session.view` and the other members described in [editing-session.md](editing-session.md); subscribe with
`session.subscribe`; redraw only the parts of the DOM whose state changed; and return a `destroy` that unsubscribes
and removes what you added. Public classes and variables are only the `sce-` and `--sce-` names documented here and in
[theme.md](theme.md); everything else is private.
